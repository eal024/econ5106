# # Residual weights with TWFE models -------------------------------------

# Problem with differently-timed treatments -> is that treated obs (T above mean) get negative weights (and vice versa)
# not always a problem, but some time it can be.
# Jakiela -> give diagnostics to help determine if there are serious issues with these residualized treatment weights

# Remember from the simple example with fake data that observations in the treatment group typically have positive treatment weights, 
# while those in the comparison /
# control group have negative weights. With TWFE, some observationsâ€™ weights switch directions. 
# There are systematic reasons for this. According to Jakiela (2021, 5), 
# negative weights in treated observations are more likely in (1) early adopter countries, since the country -
# level treatment mean is high, and (2) later years, since the year - level treatment mean is higher.
